### GitHub repo for hosting MTVehicle's auto-updater.

- `index.html` contains the latest version of the plugin (e. g. '2.5.5')
- if your server version is not the same as the latest version, auto-updater pop up will be shown to you (unless it's disabled)
- this allows us to make changes to the auto-updater even if a version is deployed
